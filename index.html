    <p>The Jenkins architecture is designed for distributed build environments. It allows us to use different environments for each build project balancing the workload among multiple agents running jobs in parallel.

The Jenkins controller is the original node in the Jenkins installation. The Jenkins controller administers the Jenkins agents and orchestrates their work, including scheduling jobs on agents and monitoring agents. Agents may be connected to the Jenkins controller using either local or cloud computers.

The agents require a Java installation and a network connection to the Jenkins controller. View the 3 minute video below for a brief explanation of Jenkins agents.</p>
